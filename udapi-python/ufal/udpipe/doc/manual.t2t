== Download ==[download]

UDPipe releases are available on [GitHub http://github.com/ufal/udpipe], either as
a pre-compiled binary package, or source code only. The binary package contains Linux,
Windows and OS X binaries, Java bindings binary, C# bindings binary, and source
code of UDPipe and all language bindings). While the binary
packages do not contain compiled Python or Perl bindings, packages for those
languages are available in standard package repositories, i.e. on PyPI and CPAN.

=== Language Models ===[language_models]

To use UDpipe, a language model is needed. The language models are available
from [LINDAT/CLARIN http://www.lindat.cz] infrastructure and described further
in the
%web% [UDPipe User's Manual udpipe/users-manual].
%manual% [UDPipe User's Manual #users_manual].
Currently the following language models are available:

- CoNLL17 Shared Task Baseline UD 2.0 Models: [udpipe-ud2.0-conll17-170315 http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-1990] ([documentation http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe/users-manual#conll17_shared_task_baseline_ud_20_models])
- Universal Dependencies 1.2 Models: [udpipe-ud1.2-160523 http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-1659] ([documentation http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe/users-manual#universal_dependencies_12_models])

UDpipe is available as a standalone tool and as a library for Linux/Windows/OS
X. It does not require any additional libraries. As any supervised machine
learning tool, it needs trained linguistic models.
