UDPipe
=======

UDPipe is an trainable pipeline for tokenization, tagging, lemmatization and
dependency parsing of CoNLL-U files. UDPipe is language-agnostic and can be
trained given only annotated data in CoNLL-U format. Trained models are provided
for nearly all UD treebanks. UDPipe is available as a binary, as a library for
C++, Python, Perl, Java, C#, and as a web service.
